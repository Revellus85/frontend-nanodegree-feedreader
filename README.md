# Feed Reader Test
Open `index.html` in a Google Chrome web browser and check if all jasmine tests are passing - Jasmine files included in repo.

## How to Use
Update feedreader.js to add more tests as needed. Just remove the link to the feedreader file in `index.html` when you no longer need to test.
